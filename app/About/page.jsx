            Parre' Textile is the culmination of a wonderful 40-year journey in
            the Decorative Textile and Home Furnishings Industry. Foundations of design were formed in the early years with the likes
            of Schumacher, Osborne &amp; Little, Jim Thompson and many fine
            boutique companies throughout the decades. The company represents a love and a desire to bring beautiful,
            printed textiles of color to interior designers to design the finest
            homes worldwide. “Franglasiam”, is what describes the company best. A little bit of
            French, A bit of English, a bit of Asia and a bit American. Parre' is a privately held, family run company made up of a Father
            and his 2 children as the management team.
